## Overview

<section class="intro">

We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib.

stdlib ([/ˈstændərd lɪb/][ipa-english] "standard lib") is a standard library with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js. The library provides a collection of robust, high performance libraries for mathematics, statistics, data processing, streams, and more and includes many of the utilities you would expect from a standard library.

What sets stdlib apart is its fully decomposable architecture, which allows you to swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.

When you use stdlib, you can be confident that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code available.

Want to join us in bringing numerical computing to the web? **Start by starring the project.** :star2:

Explore this GitHub repository for stdlib's source code and documentation. For guidance on developing stdlib, refer to the [development guide][stdlib-development].

Thank you for being a part of our community! Your support is invaluable to us!
